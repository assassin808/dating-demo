## The Big Idea

Instead of matching people based on static profiles, we **simulate the relationship first**. 


## Vision

Build interactive matching systems where users:
- Watch their "Live Love Show" — personalized relationship simulations
- Explore "what-if" scenarios by injecting critical events
- Iteratively refine their persona agents for better self-understanding
