> Persona-Based Romantic Compatibility Through LLM Text World Engines

---

## The Big Idea

Instead of matching people based on static profiles, we **simulate the relationship first**. 

Our framework uses LLMs as text world engines—operating as both persona-driven agents and the environment itself—to predict romantic compatibility through interaction dynamics rather than feature similarity.

## How It Works

1. **Persona Generation** — Transform user profiles into rich natural language personas
2. **Interaction Simulation** — LLM agents interact with private thoughts (`<INNER_THOUGHT>`) and public dialogue (`<RESPONSE>`)
3. **Love Observer** — Specialized LLM extracts compatibility scores from simulated relationship trajectories

## Key Innovation

**Critical Events Hypothesis**: Relationship outcomes are determined by responses to sparse critical moments, not every interaction. We formalize compatibility as a reward modeling problem where simulated agent behavior predicts real-world relationship success.

## Results

Validated on two tasks:
- **Speed Dating**: Predicts mutual "yes" decisions from simulated first conversations
- **Divorce Prediction**: Identifies risk through simulated responses to critical events

Our approach outperforms traditional similarity-based baselines.

## Vision

Build interactive matching systems where users:
- Watch their "Live Love Show" — personalized relationship simulations
- Explore "what-if" scenarios by injecting critical events
- Iteratively refine their persona agents for better self-understanding
